# DX-BALL
This is a 2D game, developed by C language with Visual Studio 2010 IDE. This game is developed for two levels.
To go through the actual solution file the repository is: 

iGraphic1.2VS10/iGraphic1.2VS10.sln

All the images are in the following directory:

iGraphic1.2VS10/iGraphic1.2VS10

For better visualization of the game I have uploaded a video, which you can find in DX_BALL.webm file.
There is also 'Snapshot' folder in which I have uploaded the snaps of two levels of the game.

The features of this game are:

1. Various power-ups appear when hitting random blocks.
2. Grabbing different 'Fruits' and 'Stars', the score will be increased in different ratio.
3. Initially, there will be 'one' life but grabbing heart, you will get the opportunity to have some extra life.
4. Grabbing 'Danger' will cost you one life.
5. By taking 'Increased paddle' the paddle size will increase and taking 'decreased paddle' opposite incident will occur.
6. By taking 'Shooting' power-up, you will get the chance to break the bricks by shooting.

More developments are needed in this project. 

Thank you.
